                Third of Einstein's four papers in November 1915. A pivotal paper in which Einstein shows that general relativity explains the 
                anomalous precession of the planet Mercury, which had vexed astronomers since 1859. This paper also introduced the important 
                calculational method, the post-Newtonian expansion. Einstein also calculated correctly (for the first time) the bending of 
                light by gravity.

            <img src="images/paper.png" alt="Paper Image" class="paper_img">
            <p>
                Seminal paper in which Einstein showed that Planck's quantum hypothesis E=hÎ½ could be derived from a kinetic rate equation. 
                This paper introduced the idea of stimulated emission (which led to the laser and maser), 
                and Einstein's A and B coefficients provided a guide for the development of quantum electrodynamics, 
                the most accurately tested theory of physics at present. 
                In this work, Einstein begins to realize that quantum mechanics seems to involve probabilities and a breakdown of causality.

            <h2>Quantum Theory of the Monatomic Ideal Gas</h2>
            <img src="images/paper.png" alt="Paper Image" class="paper_img">
            <p>
                First of two seminal papers, in which Einstein creates the theory of identical particles in quantum mechanics. 
                In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck's law of black-body radiation from a modification of coarse-grained counting of 
                phase space. Einstein shows that this modification is equivalent to assuming that photons are rigorously identical, 
                leading to the concept of coherent states. Einstein also extends Bose's formalism to material particles (bosons), 
                predicting that they condense at sufficiently low temperatures, as verified experimentally.
